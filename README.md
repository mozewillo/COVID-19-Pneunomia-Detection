# COVID-19-Pneunomia-Detection

Project created for SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection

### Description
The aim of this project is to take part in a kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection) oriented on creating a mcomputer vision tool for automated recognition of COVID caused pneunomia. 

Our task is to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. The imaging data used for model training was annotated by a group of radiologists.
