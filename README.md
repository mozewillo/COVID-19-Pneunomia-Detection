ROCS (Recognition of Optical Chemical Structures)

### Description
The aim of this project is to take part in a kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bms-molecular-translation/overview/description) oriented on creating a machine learning based tool for automated recognition of optical chemical structures. Since there are decades of scanned documents that can't be automatically searched for specific chemical depictions, the problem is significant for scientists, especially in the field of organic chemistry. Successful annotation of images with an InChI ([International_Chemical_Identifier](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier)) might speed up research and development efforts.
